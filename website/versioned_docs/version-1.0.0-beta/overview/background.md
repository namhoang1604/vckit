# Background

## History of Verifiable Credentials

Verifiable credentials have emerged as a powerful solution for addressing the challenges associated with digital identity management and trust in the online world. The concept of verifiable credentials dates back to the emergence of self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems, which aimed to provide individuals with control over their personal information and enable secure, privacy-preserving interactions online.

Verifiable credentials build upon the principles of SSI by enabling the issuance, presentation, and verification of digital credentials in a decentralized and tamper-evident manner. This approach eliminates the need for centralized authorities and puts individuals in control of their credentials, empowering them to selectively disclose relevant information as needed.

## Benefits of Verifiable Credentials in Cross-Border Trade

Verifiable credentials have significant advantages when applied to cross-border trade scenarios. By leveraging this technology, organizations involved in cross-border trade can benefit from:

1. **Enhanced Trust**: Verifiable credentials enable the establishment of trust between different parties involved in cross-border trade. The cryptographic nature of credentials ensures the integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of the shared information, fostering trust and reducing the reliance on intermediaries.

2. **Streamlined Processes**: With verifiable credentials, cross-border trade processes can be streamlined and automated. By digitizing and standardizing credentials, organizations can significantly reduce manual paperwork, eliminate inefficiencies, and expedite the verification and validation of credentials, leading to faster and more efficient trade operations.

3. **Privacy Preservation**: Verifiable credentials enable organizations to share only the necessary information without compromising individuals' privacy. Through selective disclosure, organizations can ensure that sensitive data is only shared on a need-to-know basis, minimizing the risk of data breaches and enhancing privacy protection.

4. **Interoperability**: Verifiable credentials adhere to open standards, ensuring interoperability between different systems and organizations. This interoperability enables seamless integration with existing cross-border trade ecosystems, promoting collaboration, and reducing integration complexities.

## Challenges in Applying Verifiable Credentials to Organizational Contexts

While verifiable credentials offer immense potential in cross-border trade, there are specific challenges when applying concepts from the self-sovereign identity space to organizations with multiple employees managing credentials on behalf of the organizations:

1. **Credential Management**: Organizations with multiple employees require efficient mechanisms for managing credentials on behalf of the organization. This involves securely issuing and revoking credentials, managing permissions and access controls, and ensuring proper governance and oversight.

2. **Trust Hierarchy**: In organizational contexts, a hierarchical trust model often exists, where certain employees are authorized to issue credentials on behalf of the organization. Implementing verifiable credentials within this hierarchy requires careful consideration of trust relationships, authorization mechanisms, and identity governance.

3. **Long Supply Chains**: Cross-border trade involves complex supply chains spanning multiple organizations and jurisdictions. Verifiable credentials must traverse these long supply chains while maintaining their integrity and verifiability. Ensuring the smooth flow of claims and verifying their validity throughout the entire chain becomes a crucial challenge in cross-border trade scenarios.

Despite these challenges, the adoption of verifiable credentials in cross-border trade holds tremendous potential for revolutionizing trust, security, and efficiency in global trade operations. By addressing these challenges and leveraging the benefits of verifiable credentials, organizations can unlock new opportunities and streamline their cross-border trade processes effectively.

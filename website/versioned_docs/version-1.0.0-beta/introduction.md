Welcome the vc-kit documentation site.

## How to use these docs

These docs are aimed at two primary audiences, across both public and private sectors:

1. Decision makers involved in driving innovation in the cross border trade space
2. Developers involved in assessing or implementing Verifiable Credentials solutions in the context of cross border trade.

These two perspectives are not inherently distinct, but the structure of these docs seeks to seperate implementation details and "how to" guides from broader conceptual discussion. We hope that this affords the ability for readers to choose the perspective from which they would like to view this site.

Decision Makers can read through linearly until you reach the Roadmap. This should give you a clear picture of the context in which vc-kit sits, it's goals, current state, and direction. You should also gain a clear picture of how vc-kit can assist you in adopting a verifiable credentials solution that is conformant with international standards.

Developers can either read linearly through from the Overview, or, if you are already familiar with the SSI/VC space, skip straight to the the Quickstart Guide.

## Prerequisites

As a Decision Maker, we assume you are already familiar wiith Verifiable Credentials. We will be using some terminology in the overview section that you can look up [here](link to glossary). Being conversant with the idea of VCs, having a quick skim of the glossary, and having a background in the cross border trade space should put you on the right footing to follow the conceptual portions of these docs.

> We have assumed some familiarity with Verifiable Credentials as a concept in these docs. If you think it would be an improvement to include some foundational material here, you could raise a GitHub issue, or send a message on Discord.

## Interactive demos

The vc-kit project includes a number of interactive demos that can be used to quickly get a hands on feel for the software without having to set up your own instance.
